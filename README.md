Simple Tic-Tac-Toe game to play two-player locally or single-player against the computer (the computer uses the Minimax algorithm to play).

To play run "python TicTacToe.py" or "python3 TicTacToe.py"

MinimaxTest.py simulates games to prove that the minimax algorithm works and that the AI cannot lose.
